## Description

FB Messenger Chat bot + Frontend Client Dashboard for automated bookings for small businesses.

### Inspiration
Oftentimes, it is difficult to schedule convenient appointments that work for us due to overhead or lack of staff. But what if we knew who was available and scheduling without having to ever call the office? Botbooker is available 24/7 to assist users in scheduling their appointments at times that are most convenient for them. No longer do users have to wait to get in touch with a secretary to schedule appointments.

### What it does
Removes the friction of maintenance and setting up of a booking system for small businesses that cannot afford electronic booking systems

### How we built it
Chatbot using FB Messenger API + Frontend Client dashboard built using Angular 1.5x

### Challenges we ran into
Defining our problem and use cases, pivoting between ideas, backend integration between chatbot + dashboard

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
* Learning how to make a chatbot on messenger (none of us have done so before)
* Joey's first hackathon!

## What's next for Bot Booker
